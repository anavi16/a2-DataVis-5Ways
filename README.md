So, I shouldn't have started with JS and d3 considering the struggle I had on the first assignment. I was pretty determined to get it right and once
I did, it was pretty fun to play around with and using the localhost (as I'd never used one before). I used the d3 website the most to help me through the process of all the functions and layouts. (https://d3js.org/ and https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15417437/d3-js-loading-local-data-file-from-file just to try to get it explained to me)

I've only coded in Python a handful of times, and thankfully during one of my classes last year we made a similar graph so I had a pretty good idea of how to do this one. I used Jupyter Notebook (provided by WPI) to compile everything. 
of what the process was.

I've worked with R a fair amount in the past, I used the library tidyverse. Tidyverse is just another library with ggplot2 in it. It's worked for me in the past so I figured I'd use it here too.

I had never heard of Tableau before so I wanted to see what it was all about. I really liked this tool, it was really straightforward and had a drag and drop system. Once you upload your CSV it's all very simple from there. It allows you to add a ton of features to your graph like different shapes or outlining said shapes.

Datawrapper was similar to Tableau in the sense of simplicity. It's a free online data visualizer that has you upload your data and refine all your data to make the graph how you'd like.
